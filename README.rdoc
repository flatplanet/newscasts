I like to watch local television news from several cities across America.

All the news channels stream live online.

This app creates a simple web interface with a navbar linking to all the
local newscasts and showing them in a frame that I can watch without
needing to look up their URL's every time.

Right now I list newscasts from:

* Chicago

* Las Vegas

* Los Angeles
