I like to watch local television news from several cities across America.

All the news channels stream live online.

This app creates a simple web interface with a navbar linking to all the
local newscasts and showing them in a frame that I can watch without
needing to look up their URL's every time.

Right now I list newscasts from...

* NBC

* ABC

* CBS

* Fox


In the cities...

* Chicago

* Las Vegas

* Los Angeles

NOTE:  I used frames. I know, I know, I know...but it was fast and easy and did what I needed it to do so give me a break!
